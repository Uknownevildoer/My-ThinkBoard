## Project Overview
My-ThinkBoard is a modern, secure, and responsive note-taking app. It features user authentication, user-specific notes, profile management, password change, and a beautiful UI powered by DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS. The backend is secured with JWT, CORS, and rate limiting.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register, login, and logout with JWT-based authentication.
- **User-Specific Notes:** Each user can only see and manage their own notes.
- **Profile Management:** Update your username, email, and password from the profile page.
- **Protected Routes:** Only authenticated users can access notes and profile pages.
- **DaisyUI Styling:** Clean, modern, and responsive UI.
- **Production-Ready CORS:** Only allows requests from your deployed frontend.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects the backend from abuse (Upstash Redis).
- **Toast Notifications:** Friendly feedback for all actions.
